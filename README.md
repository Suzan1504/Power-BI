**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

This Power BI project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of a global superstore's sales data, utilizing Power BI's robust suite of tools including Power Query for data transformation, and a variety of visualizations to uncover insights into sales performance, profit ratios, and market trends. By dissecting data across multiple dimensions such as sub-category, country, region, time (year and month), market segments, and individual product performance, the project aims to deliver actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions.


**OBJECTIVES**

**Sales Analysis by Sub-Category and Market**: To identify which sub-categories and markets are performing well and which are underperforming, helping to tailor inventory and marketing efforts accordingly.

**Regional and Country-Level Performance**: To analyze sales and profit trends across different countries and regions, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for expansion.

**Profit Ratio Trends**: To track profit ratios over time (by year and month), identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies for further investigation.

**Segment Analysis**: To understand sales performance across different customer segments, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

**Product Performance Ranking**: To identify the top 5 and bottom 5 performing products, offering insights into product lifecycle management and development opportunities.


**TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES**

**Power BI Desktop**: The primary tool for data modeling, analysis, and visualization, offering a comprehensive platform for business intelligence activities.

**Power Query**: Used within Power BI for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), ensuring the data is clean and structured for analysis.

**Visualizations**: Utilization of a variety of charts and visual tools within Power BI, including:

**i) Funnel Charts**: For visualizing sales conversion rates or product pipeline stages.

**ii) Line Charts**: For trend analysis over time, such as sales or profit trends.

**iii) Map Visualizations**: To geographically represent sales and profit data across different countries and regions.

**iv) Bar and Column Charts**: For comparing sales, profits, or other metrics across categories, segments, or time periods.

**v) Pie and Donut Charts**: For showcasing proportional distributions, such as market share or segment distribution.


**PROJECT STRUCTURE**

**Data Preparation and ETL**: Leveraging Power Query to import, clean, and structure the global superstore dataset for analysis.

**Data Modeling**: Building relationships between different data tables to enable comprehensive cross-dimensional analysis.

**Analysis and Visualization**:

**i) Sales Performance Dashboard**: Interactive visualizations showcasing sales by sub-category, country, region, and market segments.

**ii) Profit Analysis Line Chart**: Detailed profit ratio trends over time, visualized through line chart.

**iii) Market and Segment Insights**: Analysis of sales performance across different markets and customer segments, using pie charts for distribution analysis.

**iv) Product Performance Analysis**: Ranking of the top 5 and bottom 5 products, visualized through a combination of bar and funnel charts.

**Insights and Recommendations**: A summary page within the Power BI report providing key insights derived from the analysis and actionable recommendations for business strategies.
